About inCubegg

This project serves as a concept for a platform to help kick start aspiring entrepreneurs aiming to do F&B start-ups.
Created using React Application and Material UI development as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.


Motivation

Having been a founder of an Education and a Food & Beverage Start-up, i wanted to create a concept of a platform that can help aspiring entrepreneurs take their first step towards building their own dreams.   

Overview

What is it?

An App with useful tools that provide information and snippets of how and where aspiring restauranteers can begin their conceptualization.

What it does?

- user can use the website to check if the business name they have in mind is in use, or available.
- user can look up the various cuisines and meal type (e.g breakfast, lunch, dinner) and keywords (e.g beef, chicken).
- user can look into the ingredient list so as to help them in planning for the COGS as well as hiring chef specialising in the cuisine.
- user can shortlist the dishes to help them plan the menu.


Features

Current

Business Checker:
  - Takes in a string, returns businesses with name containing string.
  - Let user know if the name they have in mind is not in use and can be registered.
